-- Documentation migration for invitation acceptance timing fix
-- This migration documents the frontend timing fix for invitation acceptance

-- This is a documentation-only migration to record the frontend timing fix
-- that was applied to prevent race conditions in invitation acceptance.

-- Frontend Fix Applied:
-- - Added 500ms delay before refreshing data after invitation acceptance
-- - This ensures the database has time to process the status update
-- - Prevents race conditions where UI refreshes before database update completes

-- The fix was applied in contexts/AuthContext.tsx in the acceptInvitation function:
-- 
-- Before:
-- await fetchInvitations()
-- await fetchProjects()
--
-- After:
-- await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500))
-- await fetchInvitations()
-- await fetchProjects()

-- This migration serves as documentation and doesn't change any database schema.
