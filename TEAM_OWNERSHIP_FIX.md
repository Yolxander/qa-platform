# Team Ownership Fix

## Problem
Users who create teams were not automatically added as team members, causing incorrect badge display and ownership tracking issues.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Function (`create_team_with_owner`)
- **Purpose**: Creates a team and automatically adds the creator as a team member with 'owner' role
- **Migration**: `20250127000005_auto_add_team_creator_as_owner.sql`
- **Features**:
  - Validates user authentication
  - Checks project ownership
  - Creates team with proper metadata
  - Auto-adds creator as team member with 'owner' role
  - Handles conflicts gracefully

### 2. Frontend Updates
- **NewTeamForm**: Updated to use `create_team_with_owner` function
- **EditTeamForm**: Updated to use `create_team_with_owner` function for new teams
- **Teams Page**: Updated logic to check actual team membership role instead of project ownership

### 3. Ownership Logic Fix
- **Before**: All project owners saw "Owner" badge for all teams
- **After**: Only users with 'owner' role in team_members see "Owner" badge
- **Logic**: Checks `userMember?.role === 'owner'` instead of project ownership

## Expected Behavior

### For Team Creators:
- ✅ Automatically added as team member with 'owner' role
- ✅ See "Owner" badge with crown icon
- ✅ Can manage team members

### For Invited Users:
- ✅ See "Invited" badge with user-check icon
- ✅ Cannot manage team members (view only)

### Database Changes:
- ✅ Existing team creators automatically added as team members
- ✅ New teams automatically add creator as owner
- ✅ Proper role-based ownership tracking

## Migration Applied
```sql
-- Auto-adds existing team creators as team members
INSERT INTO team_members (team_id, user_id, role)
SELECT t.id, t.created_by, 'owner'
FROM teams t
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM team_members tm 
    WHERE tm.team_id = t.id AND tm.user_id = t.created_by
)
```

## Testing
1. Create a new team - creator should be automatically added as owner
2. Check teams page - should show correct badges
3. Invite users to team - they should see "Invited" badge
4. Team creator should see "Owner" badge
