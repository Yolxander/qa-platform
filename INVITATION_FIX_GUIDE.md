# Invitation System Fix Guide

## üö® Current Issue
You're getting **500 Internal Server Error** when trying to fetch invitations because the database functions are missing.

## ‚úÖ Solution

### Step 1: Run the Database Setup Script

1. **Open your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to your Supabase project
   - Navigate to the SQL Editor

2. **Copy and paste the setup script**
   ```bash
   # In your terminal, run this command to copy the script:
   cat db-schemas/functions/complete-invitations-setup.sql
   ```

3. **Execute the script in Supabase SQL Editor**
   - Paste the contents into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to execute

### Step 2: Verify the Setup

1. **Test the functions**
   ```bash
   # Copy this script and run it in Supabase SQL Editor:
   cat db-schemas/functions/test-functions.sql
   ```

2. **Expected results:**
   - ‚úÖ get_user_invitations function exists
   - ‚úÖ create_team_invitation function exists  
   - ‚úÖ accept_team_invitation function exists
   - ‚úÖ team_invitations table exists

### Step 3: Test the Application

1. **Restart your Next.js app** (if running)
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Log in and test**
   - Log in to your application
   - Check the notifications page at `/notifications`
   - The 500 errors should be resolved

## üîß Alternative: Quick Fix Script

If you only want to create the missing functions:

```bash
# Copy and run this script in Supabase SQL Editor:
cat db-schemas/functions/fix-invitations-functions.sql
```

## üìã What the Scripts Do

### `db-schemas/functions/complete-invitations-setup.sql`
- Creates the `team_invitations` table
- Sets up all indexes and RLS policies
- Creates all required functions:
  - `get_user_invitations()` - Fetches user's pending invitations
  - `create_team_invitation()` - Creates new invitations
  - `accept_team_invitation()` - Accepts invitations and adds user to team
- Sets up proper permissions and triggers

### `db-schemas/functions/fix-invitations-functions.sql`
- Only creates the missing functions
- Use this if the table already exists but functions are missing

### `db-schemas/functions/test-functions.sql`
- Verifies that all functions and tables exist
- Shows the table structure
- Use this to confirm the setup worked

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If you still get 500 errors:
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Run `test-functions.sql` to verify functions exist
3. Make sure you're logged in to the application
4. Check that your Supabase environment variables are correct

### If functions still don't exist:
1. Make sure you ran the script in the correct Supabase project
2. Check for any SQL errors in the Supabase SQL Editor
3. Try running `fix-invitations-functions.sql` instead

### If you get permission errors:
1. Make sure you're running the script as the database owner
2. Check that RLS policies are properly set up
3. Verify your user has the correct permissions

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

After running the setup script, you should see:
- No more 500 errors in the browser console
- The notifications page loads without errors
- Invitation notifications work properly
- The notification badge appears in the sidebar when there are pending invitations
